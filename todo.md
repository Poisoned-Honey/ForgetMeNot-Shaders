# todo:
- fix VL on non-depressing mode (filter, etc)
- fix global illumination
- add "alternate" GI raytracer that is just raytraced ambient occlusion with extra steps (uh, not actual mathematical steps. RTAO with increased intervals)
- move changed sky stuff to sky reflection calculation too
- physically based atmosphere for sky and clouds shading, adjust terrain lighting
- add in specular highlight
